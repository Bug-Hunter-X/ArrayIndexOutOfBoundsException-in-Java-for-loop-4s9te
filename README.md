This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException caused by an incorrect loop condition. The bug.java file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.java provides the corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access an array element beyond its valid index range. The solution demonstrates how to properly iterate through an array using a loop that respects the array's boundaries.
